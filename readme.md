This program is still in early development.

Currently it is used to approximate **just-intonation intervals** (that, currently, you define manually editing the code) with intervals using different EDO systems.

For comparison purposes it also adds information about the 12-edo version of the intervals. This way you can, for example, compare which system have a major third that is closer to 5/4. Is it 12-edo or 19-edo?
